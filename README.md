# dart-ts-native-todo

A sample todo-app application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.

###### Note: I was supposed to build a todo app to teach myself dart but IDK whats going on.

- Anyway i'm still going to build a todo-app, a complex todo-app. web in ts & android with dart.
Not now but eventually.
